## Courses

### `$ vimtutor`

- Practice deliberately by doing `vimtutor` once a day for at least one week straight.
- Set a goal for yourself, see if you can get through the whole thing in 5 minutes.
- The point is not to memorize every single command.
- The point is to practice enough times until
  the basic navigation and editing commands are second nature.
