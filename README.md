## Courses

### `$ vimtutor`

1. Practice deliberately by doing `$ vimtutor` once a day for at least one week straight.
1. Set a goal for yourself, see if you can get through the whole thing in 5 minutes.
1. The point is not to memorize every single command.
1. The point is to practice enough times until
   the basic navigation and editing commands are second nature.
